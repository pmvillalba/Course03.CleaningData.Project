# Project for Course "Getting and cleaning data"

The script to perform the analysis is "run_analysis.R". In order to perform the analysis, unzip the files available in ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and move the following files to the script's directory:

	* features.txt
	* subject_train.txt
	* X_train.txt
	* y_train.txt
	* subject_test.txt
  * X_test.txt
  * y_test.txt
  * activity_labels.txt

Once the script is run, it will produce the output "tidy_data.txt", which is a text file contaning the final dataset.

To know more about the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data see ["CodeBook.md"](https://github.com/pmvillalba/Course03.CleaningData.Project/codebook.md)
